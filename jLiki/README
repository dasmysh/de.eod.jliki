# jLiki
[jLiki](http://github.com/smaisch/de.eod.jliki) is a Wiki-like web application that allows version management and online
editing of several LaTeX-documents (a document may consist of several .tex-Files). 

## Dependencies:
jLiki is a web application written in Java (1.7) for Tomcat 7.0.
The project is a Apache Maven / Eclipse project.
For an easy build you will need at least [Apache Maven](http://maven.apache.org/) which takes care of other
dependencies. To build this without Maven, the needed dependencies can be found in pom.xml.

### Database server dependency:
jLiki needs a database server to run. For standard this will be [MySQL](http://www.mysql.com/)/
[MariaDB](http://mariadb.org/) but it should be possible to replace that by any other SQL-Server. After the first run
there should be a file "config/jlikiConfig.xml" in the base directory of your Tomcat instance. The database connection
(and several other properties) can be configured there.

## Inspiration:
jLiki is heavily inspired by [Liki - The LaTeX Wiki](http://sourceforge.net/projects/liki/) which did not fit all my
requirements (performance, multiple project management, user management), so i decided to build a new one.

## Current state:
Not much is done yet ...
